          We support students develop strategies to address barriers hindering their learning and promote independence and self-management.

        <div>How do I access this support?</div>
        <div>
          The support we provide is usually funded through Disabled Student Allowances (DSA).
          If you would like to know more about whether you are eligible for DSA,
          it’s best to speak with your Disability Advisors based at your place of study.
          They will be able to tell you what sort of help is available and how you can access it.
        </div>
        <div>
          DSA is available to both full-time and part-time students.
          You may apply for DSA even if you have already taken a higher education course,
          although you can’t apply for more than one at a time.

        <div>
          Once your application for the Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA) has been accepted,
          the funding provider may ask you to book a Study Needs Assessment.
          The cost of this assessment is paid through the Disabled Students' Allowances.
          The Study Needs Assessment is an informal meeting with an experienced Needs Assessor
          to help decide the kind of support that will assist you with your own particular needs.
